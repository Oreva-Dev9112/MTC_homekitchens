# MTC Home Kitchens

Pixel-perfect, multi-stack implementation of the MTC Home Kitchens homepage for a real-world technical interview.  
**Challenge:** Given a high-fidelity Adobe XD design, build a fully responsive, modern homepage with pixel accuracy—demonstrating expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP.

## 🚀 About This Project

This repository is a showcase of my front-end and full-stack skills for the MTC Media Ltd interview process.  
You’ll find **three separate implementations** of the same design—each using a different technology stack to match any workflow:

- **MTC-HTML**: Static, handcrafted HTML, CSS (Tailwind, custom CSS), and JavaScript.
- **MTC-PHP**: PHP modular structure for easy templating, including partials for maintainability.
- **MTC-REACT**: Modern React build (with create-react-app or Vite), using components and best practices.

Each version is fully responsive, pixel-perfect, and tested across modern browsers.
