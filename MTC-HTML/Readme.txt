The challenge is to create a living breathing homepage from a mockup that has been designed from our design team.  We’re looking for pixel perfection with a good responsive solution

You can use javascript libraries, but you may wish to demonstrate your knowledge of writing custom code.

Please do this task using your own techniques - we’re keen to see how you would tackle this.

All assets can be found in the attached .xd file and here - https://xd.adobe.com/view/cffd8229-5018-4e51-82f0-87f5b18ef0fc-9aae/ (click the code icon in the sidebar)

The site:
●	is a simple design however we expect pixel perfect accuracy. 
●	should function in all modern browsers.
●	should be fully responsive

Please send us a link to the fully compiled working version of the page on some web space and a copy of the code.

Additional notes if this is a wordpress trial

We would like to see this running on a wordpress installation with some content fields hooked up - don’t worry aboout ecom functions for now - ACF + Wordpress is ideal.

use good wordpress practice! Feel free to create a theme or do something fancier - e.g. headless!
